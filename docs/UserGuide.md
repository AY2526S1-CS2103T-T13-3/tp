## Introduction

#### Who is PlayBook for?

PlayBook is designed specifically for **semi-professional youth football coaches** who:
* Manage multiple teams (e.g., U16, U18, U21 squads)
* Need to track 20-50+ players across different age groups
* Prefer keyboard-based workflows for faster data entry
* Are comfortable with basic command-line operations
* Need quick access to player availability, injuries, and team assignments

#### What you should know before using PlayBook

**Technical Requirements:**
* Basic familiarity with command-line interfaces (typing commands rather than clicking buttons)
* Basic ability to navigate folders and run programs from a terminal
* Java 17 installed on your computer

**No prior coding experience needed** - all commands are simple, English-based instructions like `add`, `delete`, and `list`.

#### Why choose PlayBook?

Unlike traditional contact management apps, PlayBook is **optimized for football team management**:
* **Speed**: Type commands faster than clicking through multiple menus
* **Team-focused**: Built-in support for teams, positions, injuries, and captaincy
* **Flexible filtering**: Quickly find available players by position, team, or injury status
* **Always accessible**: Works offline, with instant local storage

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

#### Installation and setup

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

   <box type="tip" seamless>
   
   **Quick help: Checking your Java installation**

   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).
    
   **Windows users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html).
    
   **Linux users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html).

   You can check your Java version by running the command `java --version` in your command terminal.
   </box>

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your PlayBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar playbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>

   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

#### Understanding the PlayBook GUI

The PlayBook window consists of:
* **Command Box** (top): Where you type your commands
* **Result Display**: Shows feedback messages after each command
* **Player List Panel**: Displays all players matching your current view
* **Player Card**: Shows individual player details including name, team, position, injury status, phone, email, address, and tags

#### Your First Commands

Type commands in the command box and press Enter to execute them. Here's a quick tutorial:

1. **Start fresh** - Type `clear` and press Enter to remove all sample data.
   
   <box type="info" seamless>

   **Expected output:** "Address book has been cleared!" and the player list becomes empty.
   </box>

2. **Create your first team** - Type `addteam tm/U16` and press Enter.

   <box type="info" seamless>

   **Expected output:** "New team added: U16"
   </box>

3. **Add your first player** - Type:
   ```
   add pl/Alex Tan p/87654321 e/alex@example.com a/123 Main St tm/U16
   ```

   **Expected output:** "New person added: Alex Tan; Phone: 87654321; Email: alex@example.com; Address: 123 Main St; Team: U16; Injury: FIT; Position: ; Tags: "
   
   You should now see Alex Tan's player card in the player list.
   </box>

4. **View all players** - Type `list` to see all players in your PlayBook.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**More example commands to try:**

* `addteam tm/U18`: Add another team named `U18` to the PlayBook.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add pl/PLAYER_NAME`, `PLAYER_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add pl/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  - e.g `pl/PLAYER_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `pl/John Doe t/friend` or as `pl/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `pl/PLAYER_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER pl/PLAYER_NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</box>

**Examples:**

* **Position planning**: Use `filter ps/ST i/FIT` to find all fit strikers across teams.
* **Injury tracking**: Use `filter tm/U18 i/ACL` to see all U18 players with ACL injuries.
* Combine multiple filters for precise results. All conditions must be met (AND logic).

**Examples:**
* `filter tm/U16 ps/FW` - Shows U16 players who play Forward
* `filter ps/FW tm/U17 i/FIT` - Shows fit Forwards from U17 team
* `filter i/Leg Broken ps/MF` - Shows Midfielders with leg broken injury

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?**<br>
**A:** Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous PlayBook home folder.

**Q: Can I manage multiple teams at the same time?**<br>
**A:** Yes! PlayBook is designed for coaches managing multiple teams. Simply create different teams using `addteam` (e.g., `addteam tm/U16`, `addteam tm/U18`) and assign players accordingly.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally delete a player?**<br>
**A:** Unfortunately, there's no undo feature. However, since PlayBook automatically saves your data, you can manually restore from a backup of the `addressbook.json` file if you made one. We recommend making regular backups of your data file.

**Q: Can a player be in multiple teams?**<br>
**A:** No, each player can only be assigned to one team at a time. If you need to move a player to a different team, use the `assignteam` command.

**Q: How do I quickly find all available players for a match?**<br>
**A:** Use the `filter i/FIT` command to show only players with no injuries. You can combine this with team filtering: `filter tm/U16 i/FIT` to see all fit players in the U16 team.

**Q: Can I track multiple injuries for one player?**<br>
**A:** Yes! Players can have multiple concurrent injuries. Use `assigninjury` multiple times for different injuries, and use `unassigninjury` to remove specific injuries when they recover.

**Q: What if I make a typo in a player's name?**<br>
**A:** Use the `edit` command to correct it. For example: `edit pl/Jon Doe n/John Doe` will rename "Jon Doe" to "John Doe".

**Q: Why can't I delete a team?**<br>
**A:** Teams can only be deleted if they have no players assigned. First reassign all players to other teams using `assignteam`, or delete the players, then delete the team using `deleteteam`.

**Q: Does PlayBook work offline?**<br>
**A:** Yes! PlayBook works completely offline and stores all data locally on your computer.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
