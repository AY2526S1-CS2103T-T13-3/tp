* This is **CS2103T-T13-3's project, PlayBook**.<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `PlayBook` (`PB` for short)
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
